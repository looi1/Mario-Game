        recently attacked by Player
        - disengages when a Player stops attacking the enemy.       
    - FeedAction
    - Steak

- SCP: Yoshi, FeedAction and Steak are their own separate classes, representing and handling the features of their own specific objects.
- OCP: Steak implements Sellable. As a new Sellable object Steak only needs to implement Sellable.getPrice() method without a need to check for the Sellable item's type to get its price.
