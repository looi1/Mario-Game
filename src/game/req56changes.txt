- Picking up Coins: 
    have Coin as an Item
        - uses PickUpItemAction, but coin goes into inventory, not Wallet
        - will have a lot of [coin, coin, coin, coin] in inventory
        - overriding PickUpItemAction to another action violates LSP
        - Solution: have coin as not portable item, addAction CollectCoinAction
        
- Wallet:
    is not a static class but rather a class with static methods

- TradeAction:
    should TradeAction hold the list of sellableitems or should toad?
        - added a new Shop class to store sellableitems (SRP?) Should toad?
        - Let's just use Toad.
