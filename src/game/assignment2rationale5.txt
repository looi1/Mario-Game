Req 5

Changes:
    - Toad now has dependencies on each item to be sold, instead of a manager
      class for all Sellable items.
    - TradeAction was replaced with BuyAction
        - This is to simplify printing of the action and buying of each item
        - Each BuyAction handles the purchase of one item
    - There is no longer a manager class that stores instances of all Sellable items
        - The original plan was to store a list of Sellable items, iterate through
          all of them to display to the menu, much like the ResetManager.
        - Every new Sellable item would only need to register as one, with no need
          for Toad to add another dependency on the new item. Hence, this complies
          with OCP.
        - However, this was not implemented for simplicity, and because there are
          only 4 sellable items.
    - CollectCoinAction was made collect coins, instead of using PickUpItemAction
        - If PickUpItemAction was used, each Coin would be added to the Player's
          inventory. This would be a waste of memory.
        - CollectCoinAction only works on Coins, and adds the value directly to
          Wallet, which keeps track of the Player's total value of Coins collected.
    - Wallet is not a static class but a class with static attributes and methods

Principles:
    OCP:
    - Interface Sellable implements getPrice() method for each Sellable item. Each
      item only needs to add one method to become a Sellable item, with no change
      in BuyAction. Hence, there can be more Sellable items with no modification to
      BuyAction.

    SRP:
    - CollectCoinAction was made specifically to handle the collection of coins.
        - As separate classes from PickUpItemAction, because of the key difference
          that this Action only works for coins, and collected Coin value goes to
          Wallet.
    - BuyAction was made to handle paying and transaction of items
    - Wallet was made to keep track of Coin balance.
        - Rather than having to keep track of the balance of total Coins in 
          inventory.
        - Only has a single purpose - to store the total balance. No other function
          is implemented in this class.

    LSP:
    - Substituting BuyAction or CollectCoinsAction with the parent class Action will
      not result in any unexpected behaviour.
    - For CollectCoinsAction, it was considered to override Item.getPickUpAction()
      with CollectCoinsAction for Coins. But the return type for 
      Item.getPickUpAction() is PickUpItemAction, and changing that would mean Coin
      cannot be replaced by parent class Item without unexpected behaviour, thereby
      violating LSP. So this was not implemented.
