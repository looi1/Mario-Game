FIT2099 Assignment 1 MA_Lab10Team3
Design Rationale
Requirement 5

New Class: Toad
-Represents the Toad, will handle all functionality relevant to Toad, such as trading and speaking.
-Inherits Actor, hence obtains all the properties and functionality of an Actor, such as spawning in location, detecting proximity to Player, etc.

New Class: TradeAction
-Handles all trading-related actions.
-Inherits Action to access all functionality related to Actions, such as displaying it in the console menu.
-With this implementation, TradeAction holds a list of SellableItems. It is assumed that the Toad-shop has unlimited stock (Player can purchase the same item multiple times). If this is not the case, a different implementation will be favoured: using the inventory of Toad to represent the shop's items.

New Static Class: Wallet
-Handles coin storing, picking up, and deduction (for trade)
-Chosen to be Static because Wallet never needs to be instantiated
-Alternative: have Wallet as a permanent item in Player's inventory. This was not chosen because Wallet doesn't share many characteristics with other items.

New Class: Coin
-Represents the coin item
-Inherits Item to access functionality common to other items which is needed for Coin, like spawning in a position, and being able to be picked up.
-Sapling has dependency on Coin to potentially spawn it in its location.

New Interface: SellableItems
-Handles the features unique to items that are sold in the shop.
-Items that implement this interface have an extra attribute price. This way, the price property of the object is stored inside the item's Class. (Class responsible for own properties)
-If another item is to be included in the shop, all it needs to do is to implement this interface and add a price property. Scalable.

New Class: Wrench
-Represents the Wrench item
-Inherits WeaponItem to access functionality common to other WeaponItems, such as chance to hit, damage.
-Implements SellableItems.

New Classes: SuperMushroom and PowerStar
[Covered in REQ 4]
-Implements SellableItems.
