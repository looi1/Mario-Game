Changes:
	- All the class that inherits from the Tree and Tree itself implements Resettable.
	- Sprout, Sapling and Mature implements Jumpable since it is considered high ground.
	- Wall also implements Jumpable.
	- Sprout doesn't associated to Goomba rather than depends since it doesn't have any
        attribute of Goomba.
	- Sapling doesn't associated to Coin, but depends on Coin since it only creating
 	  Coin object inside of its method and rather than depends on Sprout, should be
 	  Sprout that depends on Sapling.
	- Mature does not associated to Sprout and Koopa, but depends on them.

Principles:
	LSP:
	- Substituting Sprout, Sapling and Mature with the parent class Tree will not result
	  in any unexpected behaviour.
