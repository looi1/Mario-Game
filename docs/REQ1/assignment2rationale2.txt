Changes:
	- JumpBehaviour will extend from Action class rather than Actor.
	- JumpBehaviour is associated to Ground, Location and Jumpable since it is needed
	  to keep track of the Ground target and its Locaiton which is a high ground that
	  the player wants to jump onto and Jumpable to get the high ground attributes.
	- Rather than MagicalItem, it depends on PowerStar and SuperMushroom.
	- it will also depends on coin since if the Player has the capability of PowerStar
	  then the Player can directly walk to the high ground. It will destroy it to a Dirt
	  and drop a Coin with a value of 5.

Principles:
	OCP:
	- Interface Jumpable implements getSuccessRate(), getFallDamage(), getName() methods
	  for each Jumpable high grounds. Each high ground only needs to be registered
	  to become a Jumpable ground with no changes in the JumpBehaviour class.
	  Hence, there can be more Jumpable ground with no modifications in JumpBehaviour.
