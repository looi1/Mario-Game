Design Rationale
Requirement 1

A new class has been created. Because the Tree class represents all of them and may be
named its Parent class, Sprout, Sapling, and Mature will inherit from it. 
We'll also be following along the Object Oriented Program design.

New class Sprout -> Inherit from Tree class:
It's associated to Goomba because it has a 10% chance of spawning Goomba on its position
if no actor stands on the Sprout, which is why it depends on the abstract Actor class.
Depending on the probability and whether or not the actor stands on it, each Sprout can
spawn 0 or more Goomba.

New class Sapling -> Inherit from Tree class:
It's associated to Coin since it has a 10% chance of dropping a ($20) coin on its position
every turn. Sapling can only grow from Sprout, hence it is likewise depend on Sprout 
(10 turns).

New class Mature -> Inherit from Tree class:
It's associated to Sprout since it can grow a new Sprout in its surroundings every 5 turns
if it's a Dirt, which is why it's also depends on Dirt. It is also associated to Koopa
because it has a 15% chance of spawning Koopa every turn if no actor stands on it.
As a result, it is likewise dependent on the abstract Actor class.

Abstract class Tree:
We will abstract the Tree class so that it may represent all trees. It will represent
all of the trees and will be dependent on the Location class because we need to know
where each tree is in order to spawn foes and drop a coin on its location.
