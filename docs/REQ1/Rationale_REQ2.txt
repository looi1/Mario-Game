FIT2099 Assignment 1 MA_Lab10 Team 3
Design Rationale
Requirement 1

We generated a new class named JumpBehaviour that inherits from the abstract Actor class
and implements the Behaviour interface class, allowing the player to jump.

Because it is the objects that the Player can jump on (each object has a different
success rate), JumpBehaviour is dependent on the Sprout, Sapling, Mature, and Wall classes.
It is also dependent on the Location because we need to know if the objects are adjacent
to the Player.

Because the Actor can travel down immediately if the ground is not the objects from
previously, it is also dependent on Ground to check if it's a normal ground or not.

It will also be dependent on the MagicalItems class, because when the Player consumes
the Super Mushroom, he will have a 100% success rate and will not suffer any fall damage.

The enemies class will be depending on the JumpBehaviour class because if they are
standing on high ground (Wall, Sprout, Sapling, Mature), they can fall straight down
if the ground adjacent to them is normal ground.

Finally, we need to change the Display menu since we need to add an action if the
Player is next to a high ground so that the Player can jump to it.
